## Summary
*I tried to explain the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in this article. I used some part from Code Simplicity book which has a big impact on my thinking process as a developer. When I read this book, there was a lot of moment that I reacted “ohh I did this mistake, I did that too.” I mentioned some important parts of the book and combine them with my experience.*
